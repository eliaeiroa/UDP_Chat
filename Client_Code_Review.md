On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of: 5

5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the code:

Great Job Elia! Your client code compiles and runs like how it was supposed to. The only thing that I would suggest is declaring variables ahead of all the other workings of the code just so it's easier to see.
